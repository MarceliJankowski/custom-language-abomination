NAME
      basic-interpreter - basic interpreter for custom language abomination written in TS

SYNOPSIS
      There are 2 ways of interacting with interpreter:
        - Using build-in npm scripts ($ npm start -- args...)
        - Directly executing 'main.js' after TS transpilation (run: '$ npm run build' to build basic-interpreter)

DESCRIPTION
      Read README.md for project description

USAGE
      In order to interact with interpreter user MUST provide 'interactionMethod' (provided through: '-r' and '-f' flags)

      For usage information and language capability description, please refer to 'introduction'
      For a more hands-on approach, go through 'codeExamples', as they provide an array of ready-to-run programs

OPTIONS
      -h
          Get help, print out the manual and exit with 0 exit code

      -v
          Turn on VERBOSE_MODE (increases output), mostly useful for debugging purposes
          Supplying additional 'v' option will enable ULTRA_VERBOSE_MODE (outputs everything, including prototype-chain)

      -e stage (possible values: ['l', 'lexer', 'p', 'parser', 'i', 'interpreter'])
          Execute interpreter up to a given 'stage' (useful for examining interpreter stages)
          Automatically turns on VERBOSE_MODE

      -r
          Interact with interpreter through REPL (set 'interactionMethod' to 'REPL')
          This flag cannot be present alongside '-f' flag, as they have contradicting behaviour

      -f filePath (when used with: 'npm start' it's relative to the project's home directory)
          Interpret/Evaluate file located at 'filePath' (set 'interactionMethod' to 'file')
          This flag cannot be present alongside '-r' flag, as they have contradicting behaviour

EXIT CODES
      Exit code indicates whether interpreter succeeded in evaluation or failed for some reason
      Different exit codes indicate different causes of interpreter failure
      Tip: you can easilly check exit code of the latest run command/script with: 'echo $?'

      0  Interpreter succeeded, no exceptions were raised

      1  Required argument is missing (like 'filePath' after '-f' flag)

      2  Provided argument is invalid

      3  Lexer failed, exception was raised during tokenization process

      4  Parser failed, exception was raised during AST build process

      5  Interpretation process failed, an exception was raised during AST evaluation

      6  Uncaught runtime exception

      7  Uncaught runtime API exception

      255  Internal interpreter error / developer fu**ed up!
